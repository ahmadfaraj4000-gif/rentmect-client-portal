MASTER VEHICLE RENTAL AGREEMENT

This Master Vehicle Rental Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into by and between Rent Me CT / Ancona Enterprises, Inc., a Connecticut corporation ("Company"), and the undersigned renter ("Renter"). This Agreement governs all rentals of motor vehicles by Renter from Company.

VEHICLE DESCRIPTION AND CONDITION
The vehicle subject to this Agreement ("Vehicle") shall be identified in the Rental Addendum executed at the time of rental, including make, model, year, VIN, license plate number, and odometer reading.

Said documentation is incorporated herein by reference.

Renter acknowledges receipt of the Vehicle in good working order except as noted in the Vehicle Condition Report and agrees to return the Vehicle in the same condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted.

RENTAL TERM
The Rental Period shall begin and end on the dates and times specified in the Rental Addendum.

Same-day rentals are permitted subject to identity and license verification approval by Company.

Failure to return the Vehicle at the agreed time may result in additional rental charges and may constitute unlawful retention of the Vehicle.

DRIVER QUALIFICATIONS
Renter must be at least twenty-one (21) years of age and possess a valid, unexpired driver’s license.

Renters under the age of twenty-five (25) shall be subject to a Young Driver Fee.

Only drivers listed in the Rental Addendum and approved by Company may operate the Vehicle.

Operation by an unauthorized driver constitutes a material breach.

PAYMENT TERMS AND MILEAGE
Mileage: Two hundred (200) miles per day are included.

Excess mileage shall be charged at $0.35 per mile.

Unlimited mileage may be purchased for an additional fee depending upon vehicle class.

Security deposits and post-rental charges may range from $200 to $2,000 depending upon vehicle class, extent of damage, policy violations, cleaning requirements, and other contractual breaches.

Renter authorizes Company to charge any payment method on file for all authorized charges including rental fees, excess mileage, tolls, traffic violations, cleaning fees, smoking fees, damage, loss of use, diminished value, towing, storage, repossession, administrative fees, and attorneys’ fees.

Renter also authorizes Company to charge fuel charges, transportation fees, recovery fees, and all other authorized charges related to the rental.

PICK-UP AND DROP-OFF SERVICES
Company may offer vehicle pick-up and drop-off services subject to availability, scheduling, and Company approval at its sole discretion.

For locations within fifteen (15) miles of Company's designated pickup location, a $30 fee shall apply for vehicle pick-up service.

If Renter requests return drop-off transportation, an additional $30 fee shall apply.

If both services are requested, the total transportation charge shall be $60.

Company reserves the right to approve, deny, modify, or reschedule any transportation-related request at its sole discretion.

Additional charges may apply for locations exceeding fifteen (15) miles, airport coordination, after-hours requests, tolls, traffic conditions, or special accommodations.

FUEL POLICY
Renter agrees to return the Vehicle with the same fuel level provided at the commencement of the Rental Period.

Vehicles must be refueled using the fuel type and octane rating recommended by the Vehicle manufacturer. Use of improper fuel or failure to follow manufacturer fuel guidelines may result in additional charges for damages, repairs, cleaning, diagnostics, towing, loss of use, and administrative expenses.

If the Vehicle is returned with less fuel than originally provided, Company may refuel the Vehicle at Renter's expense.

Renter shall be responsible for the actual fuel cost in addition to a $20 refueling service fee.

Failure to maintain proper fuel levels may result in additional administrative or service charges where applicable.

VEHICLE RECOVERY AND RETRIEVAL AMENDMENT
In the event the Vehicle requires recovery, retrieval, repossession, improper return pickup, abandoned vehicle transport, or transportation from an unauthorized location, Renter agrees to pay all associated costs incurred by Company.

Recovery and retrieval service charges shall begin at $80 and may increase depending upon distance, labor, tolls, storage, timing, vehicle condition, or other related circumstances.

Company reserves the right to charge the payment method on file for all recovery-related costs and administrative expenses associated with enforcement of this Agreement.

SPEED MONITORING AND VEHICLE DISABLING POLICY
Renter acknowledges that the Vehicle may be equipped with GPS tracking and telematics capable of monitoring vehicle speed and driving behavior.

No driver is permitted to operate the Vehicle at speeds exceeding ninety (90) miles per hour.

Repeated excessive speed violations may result in warnings issued by Company.

After the third warning for excessive speed or reckless driving behavior, Company reserves the right to remotely disable or shut down the Vehicle where legally permitted and reasonably safe to do so.

Renter agrees that a $100 vehicle reactivation fee shall apply before the Vehicle is re-enabled for continued use.

CLEANLINESS AND DETAILING POLICY
Renter agrees to return the Vehicle in reasonably clean condition, excluding ordinary wear and minor debris associated with normal use.

If the Vehicle is returned excessively dirty, stained, muddy, contains excessive trash, pet hair, strong odors, bodily fluids, sand, smoke residue, or otherwise requires abnormal cleaning or detailing beyond standard turnover preparation, Company reserves the right to charge an excessive cleaning fee of $80 or more depending upon the condition of the Vehicle and the extent of cleaning required.

• by any unauthorized driver
• while under the influence of alcohol or drugs
• for racing or speed contests
• for towing or pushing another vehicle
• for rideshare or delivery services unless authorized
• for any illegal activity

RENTER LIABILITY FOR DAMAGE
